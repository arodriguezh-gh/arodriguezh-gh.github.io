## Project 1: Reproducibility and GitHub

In this project, I learned the fundamentals of creating a reproducible data science workflow using Git and GitHub.  
I practiced initializing repositories, cloning, committing, and pushing code, while documenting commands in markdown.  

I also collaborated with teammates through branching, pull requests, and conflict resolution.  
Finally, I set up a personal website with GitHub Pages to showcase my work.
